## Examples: Python `input( )` Function

The `input( )` function lets you prompt the user for specific information.

The `input( )` function ALWAYS collects string data from the user.  In other words, if you prompt the user for a number (such as a person's age or the length of a room), you must **convert** the user's input into a number before you can do math with the user's input.

Input is the opposite of output.
